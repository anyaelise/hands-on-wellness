	<h3>About Hands On Wellness</h3>
	
	<br>
	<p>Hands On Wellness LLC is a Miami based mobile massage therapy and bodywork company that 
		provides services to its patrons in the comfort of their homes, hotel suites, or offices. Founded
by Anya Marshall and Josephine Stedman, Hands On Wellness was conceptualized with the
intention of infusing each bodywork session with the spirit of oneness and compassion that has
been instilled in both women through their Jamaican upbringing.

Inspired by the knowledge that exceptional bodywork can do more than just relax a person, we at HOW hold the intention 
of treating the whole person and facilitating an environment for physical and emotional healing. By understanding how 
each individual uses his or her body on a daily basis, we at
HOW become capable of designing and applying the most efficient and effective modalities to
optimize and fulfill the specific needs of each client's body, mind, and spirit. We invite you to try us for yourself so you too can discover the healing power of
touch.</p>
