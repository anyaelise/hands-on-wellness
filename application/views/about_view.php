	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>One Love Bodywork LLC is a Miami based mobile bodywork company that provides massage and other bodywork services to its patrons 
		in the comfort of their homes, hotel suites, or offices. Founded by Julian Sutherland and Josephine Stedman, One Love Bodywork was 
		conceptualized with the intention of infusing each bodywork session with the spirit of oneness and compassion that has been
		instilled in them through their Jamaican upbringing.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Inspired by the knowledge that exceptional bodywork can do more than just relax a person, Julian and Josephine hold the intention of 
		treating the whole person and facilitating an environment for physical and emotional healing. All services come standard with aromatherapy,
		choice of music selection, customized guided meditations, and plenty of nurturing and caring touch.</p>
